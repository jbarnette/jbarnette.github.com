## About Me

I live in New Orleans. I have a cat and a wife, but not necessarily in
that order. I hack on lots of stuff, often with [Seattle.rb][s.rb].  I
play CTO at [Audiosocket][socket]. I don't get a lot of sleep. I have
a history of abandoning blogs. If you're paranoid, I have a [public
key][pgp].

## Colophon

I lifted every good visual idea on these pages from [TPW][] or [Khoi
Vinh][]. Underlying bits are [Jekyll][] and [Markdown][] on [GitHub
Pages][].
