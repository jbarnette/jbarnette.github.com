## About Me

I live in San Francisco and New Orleans. I have a dog and a [wife][],
but not necessarily in that order. I hack on lots of stuff, sometimes
with [Seattle.rb][]. I vacation at [GitHub][]. I don't get a lot of
sleep. I have a history of neglecting my personal site.

## Awkward Third Person Bio

John Barnette has been keeping the lights on at tech companies since
1998, most recently at GitHub. In his increasingly rare spare time he
speaks at programming and tech conferences, advises startups on
platform and software strategy, and invents new (sometimes
life-threating) cocktails.

## Colophon

I lifted every good visual idea on these pages from [TPW][] or [Khoi
Vinh][]. Underlying bits are [Jekyll][] and [Markdown][] on [GitHub
Pages][].
