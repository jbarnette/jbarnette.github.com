## About Me

I live in New Orleans. I have a cat and a wife, but not necessarily in
that order. I hack on lots of stuff, often with [Seattle.rb][s.rb].  I
play CTO at [Audiosocket][socket]. I co-founded Shady Ventures. I
don't get a lot of sleep. I have a history of abandoning blogs. If
you're paranoid, I have a [public key][pgp].

## Awkward Third Person Bio

John Barnette has been keeping the lights on at startups since
1998. He currently serves as CTO of Audiosocket, a company at the
intersection of music and technology. In his increasingly rare spare
time he speaks at programming and tech conferences, advises startups
on platform and software strategy, and invents new (sometimes
life-threating) cocktails.

## Colophon

I lifted every good visual idea on these pages from [TPW][] or [Khoi
Vinh][]. Underlying bits are [Jekyll][] and [Markdown][] on [GitHub
Pages][].
